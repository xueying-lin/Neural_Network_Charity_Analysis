# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Beks is the data analyst of the non-profit organization, Alphabet Soup. Beks needs to help figure out which organizations worth donations and which ones with high risk.
- Purpose: Use the current dataset to build a neural network model, which can accurately detect the organizations with high risk to avoid the failed donation.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
   - **Target variables**: *IS_SUCCESSFUL* variable, whether the donation for that application is used effectively or not. 
   - **Features variables**: *APPLICATION_TYPE*, *AFFLIATION*, *CLASSIFICATION*, *USE_CASE*, *ORGANIZATION* (Organization type), *INCOME_AMT* (income classification), *SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS* (special consideration for application), *ASK_AMT*(Funding amount requested) 
   - **Removed variables**: *EIN*, *NAME*, *STATUS* (Active status). The variables are removed due to the irrelavent to the models
  
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
   - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions select and why
   - able to achieve the target or not
   - what steps tried to increase performance

## Summary
overall results of the deep learning model. recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain why
