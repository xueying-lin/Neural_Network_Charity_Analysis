## Overview of the analysis
- Purpose:

## Results
- Data Preprocessing
   - Target variables:
   - Features variables:
   - Removed variables:
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
   - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions select and why
   - able to achieve the target or not
   - what steps tried to increase performance

## Summary
overall results of the deep learning model. recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain why
